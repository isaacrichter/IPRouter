Internet Data Router Simulation
Final Mini-Project, Data Structures, Spring 2020

IP Addresses are routed to ports based on rules the user adds to the router. IP Addresses can then be injected, and routing decisions are made based on the rules. 
The router is encapsulated by a single class, IPRouter, which uses the Trie class for prefix matching.
The router also has a LRU cache, which is updated after an IP Address is routed.
